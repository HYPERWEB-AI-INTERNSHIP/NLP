        "The two tables above, in each section, show the results from LDA and NMF on both datasets. There is some coherence between the words in each clustering. For example, Topic #02 in LDA shows words associated with shootings and violent incidents, as evident with words such as “attack”, “killed”, “shooting”, “crash”, and “police”. Other topics show different patterns. \n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, comparing the results of LDA to NMF also shows that NMF performs better. Looking at Topic #01, we can see there are many first names clustered into the same category, along with the word “interview”. This type of headline is very common in news articles, with wording similar to “Interview with John Smith”, or “Interview with James C. on …”. \n",
        "\n",
        "We also see two topics related to violence. First, Topic #03 focuses on police related terms, such as “probe”, “missing”, “investigate”, “arrest”, and “body”. Second, Topic #08 focuses on assault terms, such as “murder”, “stabbing”, “guilty”, and “killed”. This is an interesting split between the topics because although the terms in each are very closely related, one focuses more on police-related activity, and the other more on criminal activity. Along with the first cluster which obtain first-names, the results show that NMF (using TfIdf) performs much better than LDA."
